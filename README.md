Submission for PayPal Hackathon

Idea Title : CAMmerce

Idea:
 The idea is to let the user click an image of an object of their interest. A reverse image search would be done to 
 figure out the name/type of the object. This information is then used to query eBay/Amazon for the exact or similar
 type of object that the user wishes to buy.
 
 This prototype contains a Python script which takes an image from the webcam, and emulates a browser to do a reverse 
 image search on Google Images and gets back the name/type of the object. This is then fed into the eBay webpage to 
 show the listings for that object.
 
 A final product would have much more sophisticated features such as listing out similar and better products based on
 user reviews, and also crowdsourcing could be implemented, by letting users 'tag' the objects so that other users can
 easily find the product listing. This lets the code to be simpler as it doesn't have to use complex Computer Vision
 algorithms.
 
 It is Social in that the details can be crowdsourced.
 It is Local in that the product and it's listing is most likely relevant in their locality.
 It is Mobile in that it can be used on-the-go.
